greetings! 

Dars here, you also call me kwatro. I always try to relearn programming along with the new teachnologies. at some point, I always get stuck and eventually stop. I hate setting up the environment. I guess I have no choice but to work with it. I cannot proceed to programming if the environment is not set-up properly.
